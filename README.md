## How to contibute

1. Follow the steps in `contributing.md` and take a look at the project. If you are new to LaTeX, head over to [this](https://www.latex-project.org/about/) to get started.

2. If the LaTeX hasn't scared you off, drop us an email at `appMathCape@gmail.com` on the type of work you are willing to do and we will be in touch!

## Conventions

We have lots of them, more are being written at this very instant! We will compile all of them in a seperate file soon. These conventions aim to maximise the clarity and consistency of the material.
